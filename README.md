- Payment confirmation handled by Stripe SDK
- Webhooks verify successful transactions
- User balance updated only after payment success

**Auth & Sync:**
- Guest data stored locally in AsyncStorage
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Email verification via secure codes
- Smart merge: server data wins on login, guest progress promoted for new accounts

**Offline-First:**
- Full functionality without internet connection
- Local-first data storage with cloud sync
- Seamless transition from guest to authenticated user
